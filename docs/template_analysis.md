## ‚úÖ Justification: Automated Kanban

The Automated Kanban template is the best fit for this project because it streamlines task management while maintaining Agile principles, offering automation that reduces manual effort. 

### ‚úÖ Supports Sprint Tracking:
* Tasks automatically move between columns as their status updates (e.g., "To Do" ‚Üí "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done"), reducing administrative work.
* Ideal for self-managed projects, where automating repetitive tracking tasks increases efficiency.

### ‚úÖ Backlog Management:
* New issues automatically land in "To Do," ensuring a structured workflow.
* Keeps the product backlog visible and prioritized, making it easier to manage future sprints.

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Traceability & Collaboration:
* GitHub Issues link directly to project tasks, enabling clear documentation of work progress.
* Ideal for solo development now, but scalable as more contributors join.

### ‚úÖ Automation Features Reduce Overhead:
* Auto-close completed issues when pull requests are merged.
* Assign tasks dynamically, ensuring no critical work is lost in transition.

### Why Not Other Templates?
