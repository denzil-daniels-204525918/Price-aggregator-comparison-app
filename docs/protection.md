# Branch Protection Rules for `main`

This document explains why branch protection is enforced in this repository.

## **Why Protect `main`?**
âœ… **Prevents Broken Code** â€“ Ensures all changes are reviewed and tested before merging.  
âœ… **Enforces Code Quality** â€“ Mandates PR reviews, reducing bugs and bad commits.  
âœ… **Blocks Direct Pushes** â€“ No accidental/unreviewed changes bypassing CI.

## **Rules Applied**
1. **PR Review Required** â€“ At least 1 approval before merging.
2. **CI Checks Must Pass** â€“ Ensures tests/linting pass before merging.
3. **No Direct Pushes** â€“ All changes must go through a PR.

ðŸš€ **Result:** A stable, reliable `main` branch with fewer production issues!
