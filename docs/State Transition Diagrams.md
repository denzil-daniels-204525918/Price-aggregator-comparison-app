# ðŸ“Œ State Transition Diagrams

## Objective

Model the dynamic behavior of your system using state transition diagrams (object state
modeling) and activity diagrams (workflow modeling). These diagrams refine the system's interactions and prepare the application for detailed design and implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Scenario
Building on Agile planning and Kanban workflow, the focus here is to:
1. Define object lifecycles 
2. Map activity workflows
3. Ensure alignment with functional requirements and use cases.

## ðŸ”‘ Critical Objects
The following critical objects have been identified:

1. User Account
2. Product
3. Price Alert
4. Retailer Dashboard Access
5. Advertisement Campaign
