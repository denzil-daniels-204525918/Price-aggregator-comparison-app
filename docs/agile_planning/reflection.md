# Reflection

Having industry experience but now taking on the Agile workflow from a setup perspective presented a unique challenge. Unlike simply pulling work from an established backlog, I was responsible for structuring the entire approach. My internal understanding of how Agile is supposed to work sometimes made the process more complex than necessary. Being the sole stakeholder, I had to balance multiple roles, prioritize decisions, and ensure the methodology aligned with both immediate and long-term goals.

One of the biggest difficulties was deciding what to prioritize. Every feature felt important, as each contributed to the system’s overall success. Structuring the backlog, defining user stories, and mapping out sprints provided a framework for urgency, but prioritization was still a challenge. The designer in me often wanted to focus on features that were exciting to develop rather than those most crucial for user experience. Balancing personal enthusiasm with what the product actually needed became a key aspect of self-managing the backlog.

Breaking tasks into sprints also proved more complex than expected. Some tasks were more interdependent than anticipated, making it difficult to structure them in a linear sprint format. Since I was responsible for all roles in the project, I found myself working on entire sections before moving on to the next, rather than switching between sprints in a traditional team-based approach. Tracking tasks through GitHub Projects helped create a more realistic timeline and provided a sense of structure within the Agile system.

Despite the challenges, working through Agile processes independently was a deeply rewarding experience. The friction—whether in prioritization, estimation, or accountability—ultimately strengthened my understanding of Agile’s flexibility. This process reinforced that Agile isn’t about getting everything right the first time but about continuous learning and adaptation. As more stakeholders become involved, these challenges will evolve, but this experience has provided a solid foundation for refining processes. I can already see how it will improve collaboration and project efficiency in the future.
