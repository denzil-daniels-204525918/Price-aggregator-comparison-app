## Defining Kanban Board

Kanban boards are industry standard tools for agile teams, it's a visual tool that tracks tasks across stages. 
It helps teams manage workflows efficiently by breaking down tasks into manageable steps and ensuring transparency.
* using coloumns to represent workflow stages
* limits work-in-progress to prevent overload
* provides rea-time visibility into task statuses
* and enhances collaboration by clarifying responsibilities.

## My Kanban Board
Visualising workflow:
* The board consists of To Do, In Progress, Testing, Blocked, and Done columns, where each column represents a stage in the workflow. Team members can easily track task statuses, enhancing clarity, collaboration, and efficiency in project management.
Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP):
* To prevent bottlenecks, WIP limits restrict the In Progress column to a maximum of 3 tasks, ensuring team members stay focused and avoid overload. This promotes task completion before new work begins, improving efficiency. The Blocked column highlights stalled tasks, allowing issues to be addressed without disrupting the overall workflow.
Supporting Agile Principles:
* The board promotes continuous delivery by ensuring tasks progress seamlessly from one stage to the next. It enhances adaptability, enabling priorities to be easily adjusted during sprint reviews. The Testing column aligns with Agile's iterative feedback loops, ensuring quality control before tasks move to completion, allowing for ongoing refinement and improvement.
