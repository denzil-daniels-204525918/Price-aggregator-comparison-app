  2. Execute search queries simultaneously.
  3. Measure response time for each query.
- **Expected Result**: Response time â‰¤ 2 seconds for 95% of queries.
- **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

### Security Test
- **Scenario**: Verify secure access to the admin portal.
