## Read Me 
I added To Do, In Progress, and Done columns to align with sprint planning boards, ensuring tasks can be tracked through different stages. Additionally, I created the custom Testing column which can be used for QA and reviews, and a Blocked column for tasks or processes that are removed or delayed in Sprint 1.
