# ðŸ“Œ Backlog

---
### ðŸŽ¯ Case: Price aggregator comparison system

---

## Overview

The product backlog is a prioritized list of features and tasks essential for building the system, including both 
functional and non-functional requirements. It is organized using the MoSCoW prioritization method, focusing first on 
critical features (Must-have) and then on enhancements (Should-have, Could-have). Each backlog item is defined as a user 
story with clear acceptance criteria and effort estimates. The backlog will evolve iteratively, adapting to stakeholder 
feedback and project needs, ensuring that the system is developed efficiently with the most valuable features delivered first.

## Product Backlog Table
| Story ID | User Story | Priority | Effort (Story Points) |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| **FR-01** | As a user, I want to search for products so that I can quickly find the items I need. | Must-have | 3 |
| **FR-02** | As a user, I want to compare product prices across multiple retailers so that I can choose the most affordable option. | Must-have | 5 |
| **FR-03** | As a user, I want to filter products by price, location, and retailer so that I can refine my search results. | Must-have | 4 |
| **FR-04** | As a user, I want the system to suggest deals based on my location so that I can find the best prices nearby. | Should-have | 4 |
| **FR-05** | As a user, I want to see daily promotions and discounts so that I can take advantage of the best deals. | Should-have | 3 |
| **FR-06** | As a user, I want to receive notifications when a productâ€™s price drops so that I can purchase it at the best time. | Should-have | 3 |
| **FR-07** | As a retailer, I want to update my product prices in real time so that customers see accurate pricing information. | Must-have | 4 |
| **FR-08** | As an advertiser, I want to publish promotions on the platform so that I can reach potential customers more effectively. | Could-have | 3 |
| **FR-09** | As a user, I want to save my shopping list or share it via messaging apps so that I can keep track of my planned purchases. | Could-have | 2 |

## Justification for Prioritization

* Must-have stories are core functionalities that directly address stakeholder needs, ensuring usability and accuracy.
* Should-have stories enhance the user experience but are not immediately critical. These features improve engagement and retention.
* Could-have stories add convenience but can be deferred without affecting core functionality.
* Wonâ€™t-have stories are not in the initial scope but may be considered for future iterations.

This backlog ensures that essential features are developed first, while additional improvements can be implemented iteratively.
