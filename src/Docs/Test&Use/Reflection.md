# Reflection

Initially, translating requirements into structured use cases and test cases proved to be a challenge. 
The assignment instructions were not immediately clear, and my online research presented multiple interpretations 
that did not align with the specified deliverables.

One of the key challenges was understanding the scope of each requirement and how it translated into system interactions. 
Functional requirements, such as search functionality and price comparison, were straightforward in terms of user expectations.
However, defining these in a use case format required breaking them down into actor interactions, preconditions, and expected outcomes. 
For instance, while it was evident that a user would need to search for a product, considering the system's role in handling 
requests, filtering options, and returning relevant results required deeper analysis.

As I progressed, I realised that the Stakeholder Analysis was a valuable tool in this process. By identifying key 
stakeholders and their concerns, I could better define how they would interact with the system. 
This understanding helped clarify which actors needed to be included in the use case diagram and how their interactions should be represented.

Another challenge was ensuring completeness in the use cases. While some interactions seemed obvious, others required 
careful thought to avoid gaps in functionality. The relationships between use cases—such as inclusion (mandatory dependencies), 
extension (optional behaviors), and generalization (actor hierarchies)—required careful planning. 
Initially, I overlooked some dependencies, such as the fact that users must first search for a product before comparing prices. 
Refining these relationships strengthened the diagram's clarity and logical flow.

When transitioning from use cases to test cases, another difficulty emerged: defining concrete acceptance criteria that 
aligned with both stakeholder expectations and system functionality. For example, for a search function to pass testing, 
should it return results in under two seconds? Should it allow filtering by multiple parameters at once? Defining 
measurable success criteria was crucial to ensure that tests could validate whether the implementation met the intended requirements.

Despite these challenges, I found the process rewarding. Looking ahead, I am excited to see the final project come together.
