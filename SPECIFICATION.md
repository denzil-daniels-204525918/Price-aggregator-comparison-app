# Project Title: e.g., Price aggregator comparison app
### ShopSmart the preferred pricing app that aggregates and compares pricing and specials from major grocery stores, helping users find the best deals on food and beverages.

**Domain: Grocery stores**<br/>
&nbsp;This project focuses on grocery stores, specifically analysing food prices between shops. 
The purpose is to provide a tool that compares grocery prices to find the most affordable options. By collecting price data from various stores, the project aims to help individuals save money on essential goods.
**Problem Statement:** <br/>
South Africa has seen the impact of inflation on grocery prices for everyday consumers. (Abdul-Aziz & Alagidede, 2020) Prices normally vary from store to store, with occasional discounts and promotional opportunities being missed due to information not being readily available. The lower and middle income households tend to carry the burden of making informed descisions, when purchasing essential goods, without a centralized system that allows for price comparrision.
<br/><br/>
The system aims to consolidate information in one location, so consumers are given the opportunity to make informed descisions to efficiently manage their houshould budgets. It will ensure that users are presented with up-to-date information so to not miss out on potential savings.

**Individual Scope:** <br/>
  My role in this project would be to develop the core functionality of the price comparison app. This includes but is not limited to:
* Develop or configure a server-side application to manage data retrieval, storage, and processing
* Creating a user-friendly interface that display shop specials and price comparisons
* Testing and Quality Assurance to ensure functionality
* User acceptance testing: Gather feedback from real users to improve usability and address any concerns

#### Feasibility justification <br/>

The project is feasible as there is a clear demand for a system that enables consumers to compare grocery prices and take advantage of promotions. The necessary technologies already exist, and the required data is readily accessible. Data collection can be achieved through various methods, including APIs (where supported by stores), web scraping, partnerships, or manual entry. The system can be developed using widely adopted programming frameworks, ensuring scalability and maintainability. A structured development approach will be followed, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and iterating based on user feedback to refine and enhance the system over time.
