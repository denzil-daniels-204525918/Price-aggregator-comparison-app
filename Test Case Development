## Non-Functional Test Scenarios

### Performance Test
- **Scenario**: Simulate 1,000 concurrent users searching for products.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a load testing tool (e.g., JMeter) to simulate 1,000 users.
  2. Execute search queries simultaneously.
  3. Measure response time for each query.
- **Expected Result**: Response time ≤ 2 seconds for 95% of queries.
- **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

### Security Test
- **Scenario**: Verify secure access to the admin portal.
- **Steps**:
  1. Attempt to access the admin portal without credentials.
  2. Attempt to access with incorrect credentials.
  3. Attempt to access with valid credentials.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Access denied for unauthorized users.
  - Access granted for authorized users.
- **Actual Result**: [To be filled after testing]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]
