### Challenges faced in balancing stakeholder needs

* The user wants a seamless interaction and ease of access to information, while the system needs to support the data processing and the infrastructure.
Solution: Opt-in option for exclusive deals while using a structured development approach (Minimum Viable Product) for development.
* Integrating data from multiple sources along with the implementation of strong security measures can hamper scalability and consistency while reducing the usability.
Solution: Use APIs and supplementing with other methods where necessary, coupled with optimal login for enhanced features.
* The system would want to grow the number of users and data without degradation.
Solution: Efficient database indexing and caching mechanisms.
* Compliance with various data sharing policies from retailers and data protection laws.
Solution: adherence to legal frameworks and offer retailers data-sharing agreements.
