## ðŸ“Œ System Requirements Document (SRD) Overview
This document categorizes functional and non-functional requirements, aligning them with key quality attributes to ensure a well-structured system design. As the foundation for the system, it ensures that both business objectives and user expectations are met. 
* **Functional Requirements:** Defines the core features and functionality of the system. Focus on capabilities that directly address stakeholder concerns. Includes acceptance criteria for critical requirements. <br/>
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Address the overall system usability, deployability, maintenance, scalability, security and performance. <br/>
